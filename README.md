## About me

I am an experienced engineer with a strong proficiency in software development and test automation. My career has been marked by a consistent ability to excel in interdisciplinary teamwork, delivering robust and innovative solutions. Among the numerous proofs of concept I have developed, my most notable and recent project is a distributed performance infrastructure. This infrastructure integrates seamlessly with JMeter, Locust, and Gatling, providing results through Grafana and saving statistics in InfluxDB. Additionally, I have extensive experience with Selenium and Rest Assured, and substantial knowledge in using Wiremock, GitLab, Docker, and Kubernetes. My skill set enables me to contribute effectively to complex projects, ensuring high-quality outcomes and continuous improvement in development processes.
